Task User Guideline:

1. use train.py to train your CNN model. (use MNIST as example), save your model by model.save(yourPath)

2. Read weights from saved model(.h5 file), save the weights/bias as .npy files.

3. Read the .npy file of different layers, calculate the results by Inference Module.

4. output the result in demo.py   to your Wechat chatting room.


To achieve this, you need:
1. Android phone(no need a phone card)
2. Google Vision Kit
3. AIY projects App (available at Google Play Store) 
4. WinSCP Client (can be used to upload files), available at:   https://winscp.net/eng/download.php
5. Putty Client (can be used to make ssh connection) available at : https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html
6. such .py files
